# Personal Portfolio Website

My own website for my porftolio, projects, and writing.

This website will be my main source of sharing my work both in development and in other interesting projects.

The idea is to showcase my skills, share my software projects, share my knowledge about different things,
and provide a place where I can show all the things that I work, which may hopefully help others.

Date: 16.01.2023

Tasks:

- Create a Project component that show projects in a good way.
- Start Developing the About me Page.
- Start the 100 days of coding challenge.
- Fix the structure and the layout and create a mobile first design approach.
