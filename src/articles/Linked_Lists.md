# Linked Lists

A linked lists is a linear collection of data elements, whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory.
Each element points to the next.

It is a datastructure that consists of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.

In its most basic form each node consits of data and a reference.

This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position within the sequence during iteration.

A drawback to linked lists is that access time is linear (and difficult to pipeline).

They can be used to implement lists, stacks, queues, associative arrays and S-expressions.

Benefit:
The benefit for linked lists over conventional arrays is that list elements can be easily inserted or removed without
reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure becuase the data items need not be sorted contiguously in memory or disk, while restructuring an array at runtime is a much more expensive operation.

Linked lists allow the insertion or removal of elements in any point in the list with a constant number of operations.

## Types of Linked Lists:

- Singly-linked list

## Inserting at the beginning

## Inseting after a given node

## Inserting at the end
