# Blog Page Content

Welcome to my blog page.

Every day I will try to write about a new concept I have learned while learning how to code.

These posts are what helps me, and hopefully you, to learn more about different concepts.

We will be using the Feynman Method. This is a very popular method for learning.
Steps breakdown:

1. Learn about a topic.
2. Try to explain it to someone.
3. See what you missed.
4. Repeat steps 1 to 3.

It goes like this. Every week we will have a certain topic. Starting with CSS.
I will learn about it from different resources, create my own examples, write about it,
update what I have written over time as I learn more.
