# About me Page

Hi, I am Georgi Nedyalkov an aspiring web developer focusing on React.

For the past three years I have been working as a Real Estate Marketer working with a team on:

- Marketing Strategy and Goal setting
- Social Media Marketing
- Website Building
- Market Analysis
- Real Estate Agent - working directly with clients

But since I wanted for the rest of my life to work on something that makes me passionate, I chose development.

My very first projects solved a problem that I had trying to a market research report and analysis.

It involved inputing data in an excel spreadsheet which took almost an entire week just for entering the data.
And if I wanted to do it on a monthly basis, that would mean that I would have to do it every single week of the month.

The is how my very first project was born.
