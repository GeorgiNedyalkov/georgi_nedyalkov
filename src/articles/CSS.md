# Blog Page Content

Welcome to my blog page.

Every day I will try to write about a new concept I have learned while learning how to code.

These posts are what helps me, and hopefully you, to learn more about different concepts.

We will be using the Feynman Method. This is a very popular method for learning.
Steps breakdown:

1. Learn about a topic.
2. Try to explain it to someone.
3. See what you missed.
4. Repeat steps 1 to 3.

It goes like this. Every week we will have a certain topic. Starting with CSS.
I will learn about it from different resources, create my own examples, write about it,
update what I have written over time as I learn more.

Cascading Style Sheets

The language we use to design our webpage.

Layouts:

- Flexbox
- Grid
- Box Model

Viewport.

CSS is about how to content is organized.

Flexbox and Grids.

## Box Model

display property specifies the type of box for a given html element.
display: inline, block;

## Flexbox

Flexbox is short for flexible box model.

Flexbox is one dimentional and grid is 2 dimentional.

Flexbox is a type of container. It can overcome limitations caused by containers like block and inline.
It provides more control as we can, grow, shrink and align the items inside the flex container.

Flexbox is single-dimentional, you can either align items in a row or a column.
By default items are aligned in a row. There are two axes, the main and cross-axis.
When the flex-direction is a row the main axis is the horizontal axis and the vertical axis is the cross-axis.
Vice versie if a flex-direction is a column the main axis is vertical and the cross is horizontal.
The start and end is either top-left moving to along the horizontal in a flex direction of a roll.
The properties we choose help better control alignment, spacing, direction and eventually styling.

## Grid

More suitable to large scale layouts.

## CSS
